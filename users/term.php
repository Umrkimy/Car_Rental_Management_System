                    <p class="text-muted">
                        At Car Rental, we prioritize customer satisfaction. If for any reason you are unsatisfied with your rental experience, 
                        we offer a refund policy for eligible situations. Refund requests must be submitted at least one day before the pickup date.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        If the refund request is made less than 24 hours before the pickup date, the deposit will be forfeited. Once a rental is completed, an automatic refund will be processed based on the circumstances of the rental. Refunds may be subject to certain terms and conditions, such as cancellations made within a specified period or specific vehicle conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Please note that after 1 day before the pickup date, the deposit becomes non-refundable, and any refunds will not be issued unless in exceptional cases as outlined in our terms and conditions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="mb-4 text-dark fw-bold mt-5">Client Profit Sharing Policy</h2>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        For clients partnering with Car Rental, we implement a 5% cut from the profit generated from each rental. This contribution helps us 
                        maintain high service standards and supports continued growth and development for all our stakeholders.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        The 5% cut applies after any applicable taxes, fees, and other deductions. Clients will receive detailed statements about the profit 
                        sharing deductions and the remaining balance for each completed transaction.
                    </p>
